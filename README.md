# Feed Monitoring System

## Overview

This Feed Monitoring System is designed to track and analyze the performance of file feeds arriving from various vendors in a specified folder structure. The system captures metrics every 5 minutes, enabling real-time monitoring and alerting based on defined thresholds.

## Features

- **Dynamic Time Windows**: Calculates arrival time windows based on the earliest and latest file arrivals, allowing for flexibility in monitoring periods.
  
- **Size Range Validation**: Establishes acceptable file size ranges using historical data, alerting when files fall outside these bounds.

- **Rate of File Arrival & Folder Growth Tracking**: Monitors the frequency of file arrivals and tracks folder size growth, triggering alerts for unexpected variations.

- **Historical Metrics Retention**: Maintains metrics for the past 15 days to support trend analysis and improve alert accuracy using median values.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this system is to ensure reliable and timely data transfer from vendors, reducing the risk of data loss or corruption while providing actionable insights through alerts.
